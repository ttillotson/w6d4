      <p>La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. You can create anything that makes you happy. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

      <p>A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.</p>

      <p>See there how easy that is. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.</p>

      <p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Let your heart be your guide.</p>
